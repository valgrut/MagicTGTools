### Notes of how to cut the frames from the cards

- App: Krita

2. Drag+drop card to cut as a new layer
3. Select and Show Card in right menu, Deselect and Hide everything else
4. Select Move tool (Left menu)
5. Position card's frame into the template part
6. OPTIONAL: Scale the card to better fit the cut, if the picture is too small.
7. Select and show Selection in the right menu (layers)
8. Start to draw selection by hand along the frame edges with the selection tools from the left menu
9. `Shift + select` -> ADDS into the existing selection (so no need to start over, in case of mistakes)

11. R-click into the selection -> Cut
12. Save As:
    - New template (in case of new frames)
    - PNG (save just the cutted frame)
13. Flip the new PNG frame 90 degrees to the right (so the flat edge is on the top)
